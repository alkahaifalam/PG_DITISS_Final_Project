# PG_DITISS_Final_Project
Description : This project aims to implement a GitOps-based DevOps workflow to automate infrastructure provisioning,
application deployment, and configuration management. The primary goal is to eliminate manual infrastructure
changes by enforcing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and leveraging Git as the single source of truth. Project
Scope :Enforce strict access policies by restricting AWS console access and API key usage. Manage all
infrastructure configurations through a Git repository. Implement continuous integration and continuous
deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitLab Actions. Automate infrastructure provisioning using Terraform. Detect,
validate, and apply infrastructure changes only through automated workflows. Enhance security, compliance, and
auditability of infrastructure changes
